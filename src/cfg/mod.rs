//! Context-free grammar representation
//!
//! # Introduction to CFGs
//!
//! A context-free grammar is a formalism that is able to represent all context-free languages
//! using two sorts of symbols: terminals, and nonterminals. Nonterminals can be replaced,
//! according to the rules of the CFG, by a sequence of other symbols. Terminals cannot be
//! replaced, and thus represent the "termination" of the rewriting.
//!
//! The parsing problem is to determine whether a sequence of terminals can be "derived" by
//! repeated application of any of the rules of the CFG, and if so, what that derivation is (the
//! sequence of rules applied to which non-terminals that produced that string).
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! While many interesting languages are context-free, parsing some of them can be problematic. Of
//! particular concern are *ambiguous* grammars, where there are multiple possible derivations of
//! at least one string. Additionally, parsing CFGs is, in general, equivalent to matrix
//! multiplication, which has a complexity of at least roughly O(n^2.37). Some grammars require
//! non-deterministic execution. It is possible to use the limited subset of CFGs that are able to
//! be parsed deterministically.
//!
//! # Representation
//!
//! Here, symbols are represented as 32-bit unsigned integers, with the most significant bit used
//! to distinguish terminals from non-terminals. This leads to 2^31 possible nonterminals, and 2^31
//! possible terminals. This limitation will almost certainly never be hit in practice. Rules are
//! currently represented equivalently to a `Symbol` LHS with a `Vec<Symbol>` RHS, and a
//! `Vec<Rule>` is stored in the the `Cfg`.
//!
//! Each `Cfg` also has associated with it an `extra` field, which is a `TypeMap`. This allows
//! other libraries to store arbitrary data in the `Cfg` without fear of clashing with other
//! libraries.
//!
//! É› is represented as a rule with an empty rhs.
//!
//! # Freezing
//!
//! For efficiency, many algorithms may want to compute relations on the set of terminals,
//! nonterminals, or rules of a `Cfg`, and cache the results. However, later mutations to the `Cfg`
//! may invalidate the old computation. As a concrete example, consider the `FOLLOW` sets of a
//! nonterminal. Adding more rules can cause the `FOLLOW` sets of some nonterminals to expand. As
//! such, many of these computations should be run on a `Cfg` that cannot have rules or grammar
//! symbols added to it.  Thus, `Cfg` is a phantom type, with the extra type parameter noting
//! whether the `Cfg` is mutable or frozen.
//!
//! # Future avenues of improvement
//!
//! - Some sort of prefix trie might be nice to store the rules compactly. It seems that efficient
//!   indexing would be challenging.
